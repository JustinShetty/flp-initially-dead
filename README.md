# Fault-Tolerant Consensus with Initially Dead Processes

Section 4 of FLP (linked below) describes an algorithm that can solve consensus in an asynchronous system with $n>2t$ (strict majority of processes are correct) as long as the failures occur before the algorithm runs.

`sim.py` attempts to implement this algorithm.
